PCN Project 1
-----------------------------------

Description: I implement this project based on the code provided by Dr. Jason Joe.
Only modified the logic part, added and deleted several functions and variables.
All of the remaining is the same as what Dr. Jason Joe gave us.
For running, please type in each value accordingly with an enter.

The plot is at the same folder level as a MS Excel document.

Platform/compiler: UNIX, g++

Files:

event.cpp - Functions for inserting and removing Events from EventLists 
event.h - Data structures for Events and EventLists
main.cpp - Main program for simulation
Makefile - Makefile for simulation
output - output of the simulation
rv.cpp - Functions which return uniform and exponential random variables
rv.h - Header file for rv.cpp

Compiling instructions:
Edit Makefile to point to the c++ compiler on the local machine.
To compile, place all files within a single directory and type "make".
To run, type "sim".
